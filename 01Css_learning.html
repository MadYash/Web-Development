    <h3>We can add CSS in  3 ways </h3>
    <h3>First is inline CSS (which is not recomended)</h3>
    <h3>Second is internal CSS(better than inline but still not much recomended)</h3>
    <h3>Third and best technique is to make a seperate stylesheet known as external css </h3>
    <p style="color:blue;">This is an inline CSS</p>
    <div>This is the Example of internal CSS which is defined in head tag</div>
    <div id="External">This is the example of External CSS which is linked in the head tag Too!! </div>
